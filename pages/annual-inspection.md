# Outdoor Annual Inspection

Outdoor playgrounds need a full inspection at least once a year. **BS EN 1176-7** (the part of the standard covering installation, inspection, maintenance and operation) sets this out, and specifies that annual inspections must be carried out by a qualified inspector.

## BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177

The standard comes in parts. The main ones relevant to inspections:

- **BS EN 1176-1** – general safety requirements
- **BS EN 1176-2 to 6** – specific equipment (swings, slides, runways, carousels, rocking equipment)
- **BS EN 1176-7** – inspection and maintenance guidance
- **BS EN 1177** – impact-absorbing surfacing

BS EN 1177 sets out how playground surfacing is tested. The key measure is the **critical fall height** – the maximum height from which a child can fall onto that surface without serious head injury risk. This is tested using a Head Injury Criterion (HIC) value of 1000 as the threshold.

## What I Check

The annual inspection covers everything on site:

- All play equipment – swings, slides, climbing frames, roundabouts, springers, seesaws
- Impact-absorbing surfaces – rubber, wet-pour, bark, sand – and whether they're still adequate for the equipment's fall height
- Fixings, joints, and structural integrity
- Wear patterns and corrosion
- Entrapment hazards and finger traps
- Benches, bins, fencing, gates
- Signage and age guidance

I'm looking for wear and tear, vandalism damage, modifications that haven't been done right, and anything that doesn't meet current standards. Equipment that predates BS EN 1176 isn't automatically unsafe – but it does need assessing against current risk criteria.

## The Report

You get a written report listing everything I've found. Each item gets a risk rating so you know what needs sorting first. If there's something that's an immediate safety concern, I'll flag it on the day.

The report gives you documentation for your records, for insurance, and for demonstrating you're meeting your duty of care.

## Who Needs Annual Inspections

- Local authorities and parish councils
- Schools and academies
- Nurseries and children's centres
- Housing associations
- Holiday parks and campsites
- Pubs, hotels, and visitor attractions with play areas

I work with councils and schools across the North West. [Get in touch](/contact/) to book an inspection or ask about scheduling for multiple sites.
