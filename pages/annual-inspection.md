  key: Annual Inspection
  order: 3
faqs:
  - question: "How often does a playground need a full inspection?"
    answer: "At least once a year. BS EN 1176-7 specifies that all playgrounds should have an annual main inspection carried out by a qualified, independent inspector. Between annual inspections, BS EN 1176-7 also recommends operational checks (monthly or quarterly) and routine visual checks (daily or weekly) by site staff."
  - question: "Is a playground annual inspection a legal requirement?"
    answer: "There is no single law that says you must have one, but the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, the Occupiers' Liability Acts, and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 all create duties that make annual inspections effectively essential. Courts and insurers use BS EN 1176 as the benchmark for what counts as reasonable safety practice. Many insurance policies require an annual inspection as a condition of cover."
  - question: "What happens if equipment fails the inspection?"
    answer: "Each issue gets a risk rating based on how likely an injury is and how serious it could be. High-risk problems should be dealt with straight away — the equipment may need to be taken out of use until it is repaired. Lower-risk items can be scheduled for repair. You get a written report listing everything found, with photographs and recommended actions."
  - question: "How long does an annual playground inspection take?"
    answer: "It depends on the size of the site. A small playground with a handful of items might take a couple of hours. A larger site with many pieces of equipment, different surfacing types, and ancillary items like fencing and signage could take a full day. Every piece of equipment is individually assessed."
  - question: "What is included in the inspection report?"
    answer: "The report covers every piece of equipment on site, plus surfacing, fencing, gates, benches, bins, and signage. Each item is assessed against BS EN 1176 standards, with photographs and a risk rating. You get a clear list of what needs attention and how urgent it is. The report serves as documentation for your records, for insurance, and for showing you are meeting your duty of care."

# Playground Annual Inspection

Outdoor playgrounds need a full inspection at least once a year. **BS EN 1176-7** (the part of the standard covering installation, inspection, maintenance and operation) sets this out, and specifies that annual inspections must be carried out by a qualified, independent inspector.

## Why Annual Inspections Matter

There is no single UK law that says "you must have an annual playground inspection." But the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, the Occupiers' Liability Acts 1957 and 1984, and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 all create legal duties that make annual inspections effectively essential.

Courts and insurers use BS EN 1176 as the benchmark for reasonable safety practice. If someone is injured on your playground and you cannot show that it was being properly inspected and maintained, you are in a very difficult legal position. Many insurance policies require an annual inspection as a condition of cover.

## BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177

The standard comes in parts. The main ones relevant to inspections:

- **BS EN 1176-1** – general safety requirements
- **BS EN 1176-2 to 6** – specific equipment (swings, slides, runways, carousels, rocking equipment)
- **BS EN 1176-7** – inspection and maintenance guidance
- **BS EN 1177** – impact-absorbing surfacing

BS EN 1177 sets out how playground surfacing is tested. The key measure is the **critical fall height** – the maximum height from which a child can fall onto that surface without serious head injury risk. This is tested using a Head Injury Criterion (HIC) value of 1000 as the threshold.

## What I Check

The annual inspection covers everything on site:

- All play equipment – swings, slides, climbing frames, roundabouts, springers, seesaws
- Impact-absorbing surfaces – rubber, wet-pour, bark, sand – and whether they're still adequate for the equipment's fall height
- Fixings, joints, and structural integrity
- Wear patterns and corrosion
- Entrapment hazards and finger traps
- Benches, bins, fencing, gates
- Signage and age guidance

I'm looking for wear and tear, vandalism damage, modifications that haven't been done right, and anything that doesn't meet current standards. Equipment that predates BS EN 1176 isn't automatically unsafe – but it does need assessing against current risk criteria.

## The Report

You get a written report listing everything I've found. Each item gets a risk rating using a 5x5 matrix – likelihood of injury against severity – so you can see at a glance what needs sorting first. If there's something that's an immediate safety concern, I'll flag it on the day.

The report includes:

- Individual assessment of every piece of equipment
- Photographs of equipment and any defects
- Surfacing assessment against BS EN 1177 fall height requirements
- Assessment of ancillary items – fencing, gates, benches, bins, signage
- Risk rating for each item found
- Recommended actions with priority levels

The report gives you documentation for your records, for insurance, and for demonstrating you're meeting your duty of care.

## The Three Levels of Playground Inspection

BS EN 1176-7 recommends a three-tier approach to playground safety:

1. **Routine visual inspections** – daily or weekly checks by your own site staff, looking for obvious hazards like broken glass, vandalism, or missing parts
2. **Operational inspections** – more detailed monthly or quarterly checks focusing on wear and tear, loose fixings, and surface condition ([more about operational inspections](/operational-inspection/))
3. **Annual main inspection** – the most comprehensive assessment, carried out once a year by a qualified, independent inspector

The annual inspection is the most thorough of the three. But it works best as part of this layered system – routine checks catch day-to-day hazards, operational inspections pick up developing problems, and the annual inspection provides a full compliance assessment.

## Who Needs Annual Inspections

- Local authorities and parish councils
- Schools and academies
- Nurseries and children's centres
- Housing associations
- Holiday parks and campsites
- Pubs, hotels, and visitor attractions with play areas
