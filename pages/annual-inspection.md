The inspection of outdoor playgrounds is required annually and we undertake a full inspection of equipment including surfaces, benches, bins, signage and outer perimeter fence to identify wear and tear and vandalism along with any modifications or repairs required. All inspections are carried out to BS EN1176/1177 2008.
