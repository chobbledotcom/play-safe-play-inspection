Outdoor playgrounds need a full inspection at least once a year. This is a requirement for schools, councils, and anyone with public play equipment. I carry out annual inspections to BS EN1176/1177 standards.

## What I Check

The annual inspection covers everything on site:

- All play equipment – swings, slides, climbing frames, roundabouts, springers, seesaws
- Impact-absorbing surfaces – rubber, wet-pour, bark, sand
- Fixings, joints, and structural integrity
- Wear patterns and corrosion
- Entrapment hazards and finger traps
- Benches, bins, fencing, gates
- Signage and age guidance

I'm looking for wear and tear, vandalism damage, modifications that haven't been done right, and anything that doesn't meet current standards.

## The Report

You get a written report listing everything I've found. Each item gets a risk rating so you know what needs sorting first. If there's something that's an immediate safety concern, I'll flag it on the day.

The report gives you documentation for your records, for insurance, and for demonstrating you're meeting your duty of care.

## Who Needs Annual Inspections

- Local authorities and parish councils
- Schools and academies
- Nurseries and children's centres
- Housing associations
- Holiday parks and campsites
- Pubs, hotels, and visitor attractions with play areas

I work with councils and schools across the North West. [Get in touch](/contact/) to book an inspection or ask about scheduling for multiple sites.
