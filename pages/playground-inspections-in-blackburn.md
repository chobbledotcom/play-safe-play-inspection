      I'm Gary Spencer Bonehill, and I carry out playground inspections in Blackburn and across Blackburn with Darwen. My base in Chorley is about 10 miles from Blackburn — roughly 20 minutes along the A674. It's one of the closest areas I serve.

      Blackburn has a good spread of parks, schools, and community play areas. From Corporation Park and Witton Country Park to school playgrounds across Darwen, Mill Hill, and Ewood, I can reach most sites in Blackburn quickly and easily.

      I inspect both outdoor playgrounds and indoor soft play centres to BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177 standards.

      When you look for playground inspections in Blackburn, you'll come across the same national companies that cover most of the UK — Playground Safety Inspector, Qualified Annual Playground Inspections, The Play Inspection Company, and Wicksteed. These are large operations that dispatch inspectors across the country.

      Closer to home, ESP Play in Burnley covers the East Lancashire area. They're primarily a playground equipment manufacturer and supplier, with inspection as one of their services. They're a well-established local company, but they do also sell and install the same type of equipment they inspect.

      There's also Morral Play Services, run by an inspector named Alan, who covers parts of Lancashire and Cheshire.

      Here's what's different about working with me:

      - **Fully independent.** I don't sell, supply, or install playground equipment. I inspect it and give you an honest assessment. That independence matters — especially if you need to demonstrate to insurers or a court that your inspection was carried out without any commercial bias.
      - **You deal with me.** Not a receptionist, not an account manager. You ring me, I answer. You book with me, I turn up. If you've got questions about your report, I'm the one who explains it.
      - **10 miles away.** Blackburn is practically on my doorstep. I'm not being sent from a national dispatch centre — I'm driving down the road.
      - **25 years as a mechanical engineer.** That background means I look at equipment differently. I understand how metals fatigue, how joints wear, how fixings work loose over time. It's a perspective most inspectors don't have.
      - **RPII registered.** The same professional registration as inspectors at the big companies. Same standards, more personal service.
