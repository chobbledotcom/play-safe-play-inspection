faqs:
  - question: "What is RPII?"
    answer: "RPII stands for the Register of Play Inspectors International. It is the independent examination body that qualifies and registers playground and inflatable inspectors. An RPII-registered Inflatable Annual Inspector has been trained and examined to carry out annual inflatable inspections to BS EN 14960. You can check an inspector's registration on the RPII website at playinspectors.com."
  - question: "Is a bouncy castle inspection a legal requirement?"
    answer: "Yes. The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) requires that all work equipment, including inflatables, is inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance (HSG175) reinforces this. The key legal requirement is that the inspector is competent — an RPII-registered inspector meets that standard."
  - question: "How often do inflatables need testing?"
    answer: "Once a year for the formal annual inspection. On top of that, operators should carry out their own checks before each use — checking blower function, inflation pressure, fabric condition, anchor points, and structural integrity."
  - question: "What is the difference between PIPA testing and independent testing?"
    answer: "PIPA is a database scheme — when an inflatable passes a PIPA test, it gets a numbered tag logged on their public database. Independent testing (sometimes called in-house testing) is carried out to the same BS EN 14960 standard by a qualified inspector, and you receive a test certificate directly. Both are equally valid. What matters legally is that the inspection was done by a competent person to BS EN 14960 — not which database it's logged on. Hirers should be able to show you a valid test certificate either way."
  - question: "What happens if a bouncy castle fails its inspection?"
    answer: "The inspector records why it failed. The inflatable can then be repaired and re-tested. If it passes on re-test, a certificate is issued. If it cannot be repaired to meet the standard, it should be withdrawn from use. The inflatable must not be used commercially until it holds a valid test certificate."

# Bouncy Castle & Inflatable Inspection

Alongside play area inspections, I'm also registered to inspect inflatables – bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment. I'm an [RPII-registered Inflatable Annual Inspector](https://www.playinspectors.com/inspector/?i=6339) (registration AI0138).

## Why Inflatables Need Annual Testing

Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), any inflatable used commercially must be inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance document HSG175 reinforces this requirement. Using an inflatable without a valid annual test certificate puts you at legal risk and may invalidate your insurance.

## BS EN 14960

BS EN 14960 is the British and European safety standard for inflatable play equipment. It covers design, manufacture, and ongoing safety requirements for bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment. Annual testing checks your inflatables against this standard.

## How Testing Works

I test your inflatables against BS EN 14960 and issue a test certificate. I can do this through:

- **PIPA scheme** – a database scheme where a numbered tag is logged on a public register
- **Independent test and certificate** – tested to the same BS EN 14960 standard, with a certificate issued directly to you

Both routes are equally valid and accepted by insurers and local authorities. The legal requirement under PUWER is that the inspection is carried out by a competent person — that's what matters, not which database the result sits on. Whichever route you choose, you get a certificate proving your inflatable has been tested and meets the standard. Hire companies should keep these certificates and be able to show them to clients or councils on request.

## What Gets Checked

The annual test covers the whole inflatable:

- Fabric condition and stitching – looking for wear, tears, and UV degradation
- Anchor points – checking they are secure and in the right positions
- Blower attachments – tubes, connections, and airflow
- Structural integrity when inflated – shape, firmness, and stability
- Step and slide surfaces – grip, padding, and wear
- Seams and bonding – checking for separation or weakness
- Safety netting and containment walls
- Deflation rate – how quickly it loses air, which affects safety if the blower fails

If something fails, I'll record why and explain what needs repairing. Once repairs are done, the inflatable can be re-tested.

## Your Responsibilities as an Operator

Between annual tests, operators should check inflatables before every use:

- Check the blower is working properly
- Inspect fabric for new tears or damage
- Check anchor points are all present and secure
- Make sure the inflatable holds its shape when inflated
- Never use inflatables in winds above 24 mph – use an anemometer, not a phone weather app

## Who This Is For

Hire companies, leisure centres, holiday parks, schools, and anyone else with inflatables that need their annual test. I'm based in [Chorley](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA) and cover the North West. [Get in touch](/contact/) to book.
