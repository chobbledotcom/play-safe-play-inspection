faqs:
  - question: "What is PIPA?"
    answer: "PIPA stands for the Professional Inflatable Play Association. It is the UK's not-for-profit safety and inspection scheme for inflatable play equipment, supported by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). When an inflatable passes a PIPA test, it receives a numbered tag that can be checked on a public database. PIPA is one of two schemes recognised by the HSE — the other is ADiPS."
  - question: "Is a bouncy castle inspection a legal requirement?"
    answer: "Yes — although PIPA itself is not required by law, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) requires that all work equipment, including inflatables, is inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance (HSG175) reinforces this. Using a PIPA-registered inspector is regarded by the HSE as following best practice."
  - question: "How often do inflatables need testing?"
    answer: "Once a year for the formal annual inspection. On top of that, operators should carry out their own checks before each use — checking blower function, inflation pressure, fabric condition, anchor points, and structural integrity."
  - question: "What is the difference between PIPA testing and in-house testing?"
    answer: "A PIPA test is carried out to BS EN 14960 by a registered PIPA inspector. If it passes, a certificate and numbered tag are issued and logged on a public database. An in-house test follows similar safety principles but there is no central database or public verification. For inflatables within the scope of BS EN 14960, PIPA testing is strongly recommended as it provides the clearest evidence of compliance."
  - question: "What happens if a bouncy castle fails its inspection?"
    answer: "The inspector records why it failed. The inflatable can then be repaired and re-tested. If it passes on re-test, a PIPA tag and certificate are issued. If it cannot be repaired to meet the standard, it should be withdrawn from use. The inflatable must not be used commercially until it holds a valid certificate."

# Bouncy Castle & Inflatable Inspection

Alongside play area inspections, I'm also registered to inspect inflatables – bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment.

## Why Inflatables Need Annual Testing

Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), any inflatable used commercially must be inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance document HSG175 reinforces this requirement. Using an inflatable without a valid annual test certificate puts you at legal risk and may invalidate your insurance.

## BS EN 14960

BS EN 14960 is the British and European safety standard for inflatable play equipment. It covers design, manufacture, and ongoing safety requirements for bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment. Annual testing checks your inflatables against this standard.

## PIPA and In-House Testing

I can test your inflatables through two routes:

- **PIPA scheme** – the industry standard, recognised by HSE and councils. PIPA stands for the Professional Inflatable Play Association. When an inflatable passes a PIPA test, it receives a numbered tag that is logged on a public database and can be verified by anyone. PIPA is one of two schemes the HSE recognises for inflatable safety inspections.
- **In-house test and certificate** – also assessed against BS EN 14960. This is used for equipment that falls outside the scope of PIPA or where an in-house certificate is preferred.

Both are accepted by insurers and local authorities. I'm a PIPA-registered Inflatable Annual Inspector.

## What Gets Checked

The annual test covers the whole inflatable:

- Fabric condition and stitching – looking for wear, tears, and UV degradation
- Anchor points – checking they are secure and in the right positions
- Blower attachments – tubes, connections, and airflow
- Structural integrity when inflated – shape, firmness, and stability
- Step and slide surfaces – grip, padding, and wear
- Seams and bonding – checking for separation or weakness
- Safety netting and containment walls
- Deflation rate – how quickly it loses air, which affects safety if the blower fails

If something fails, I'll record why and explain what needs repairing. Once repairs are done, the inflatable can be re-tested.

## Your Responsibilities as an Operator

Between annual tests, operators should check inflatables before every use:

- Check the blower is working properly
- Inspect fabric for new tears or damage
- Check anchor points are all present and secure
- Make sure the inflatable holds its shape when inflated
- Never use inflatables in winds above 24 mph – use an anemometer, not a phone weather app

## Who This Is For

Hire companies, leisure centres, holiday parks, schools, and anyone else with inflatables that need their annual test. I'm based in [Chorley](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA) and cover the North West. [Get in touch](/contact/) to book.
