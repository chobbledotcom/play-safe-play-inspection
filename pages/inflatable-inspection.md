faqs:
  - question: "Is a bouncy castle inspection a legal requirement?"
    answer: "Yes. The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) requires that all work equipment, including inflatables, is inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance (HSG175) reinforces this. The key legal requirement is that the inspector is competent — not that any particular scheme or database is used."
  - question: "How often do inflatables need testing?"
    answer: "Once a year for the formal annual inspection by a competent person. On top of that, operators should carry out their own checks before each use — checking blower function, inflation pressure, fabric condition, anchor points, and structural integrity."
  - question: "What are the different ways to get an inflatable tested?"
    answer: "There are several routes. PIPA is one scheme — it logs results on a public database and issues a numbered tag. ADiPS is another HSE-recognised scheme. Qualified inspectors can also test to the same BS EN 14960 standard and issue a certificate directly. All routes are equally valid in law. What matters is that the inspection was carried out by a competent person against BS EN 14960, and that the hirer can produce a valid test certificate."
  - question: "What qualifications should an inflatable inspector have?"
    answer: "The inspector needs to be a competent person — someone with the training, knowledge, and experience to inspect inflatables to BS EN 14960. The RPII (Register of Play Inspectors International) is the independent body that examines and registers inflatable inspectors. You can verify an inspector's registration on the RPII website at playinspectors.com."
  - question: "What happens if a bouncy castle fails its inspection?"
    answer: "The inspector records why it failed. The inflatable can then be repaired and re-tested. If it passes on re-test, a certificate is issued. If it cannot be repaired to meet the standard, it should be withdrawn from use. The inflatable must not be used commercially until it holds a valid test certificate."

# Bouncy Castle & Inflatable Inspection

Alongside play area inspections, I'm qualified to inspect inflatables – bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment. I'm an [RPII-registered Inflatable Annual Inspector](https://www.playinspectors.com/inspector/?i=6339) (registration AI0138) and a [PIPA accredited trainer](https://www.pipa.org.uk/contact/pipa-accredited-trainer/).

## Why Inflatables Need Annual Testing

Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), any inflatable used commercially must be inspected annually by a competent person. HSE guidance document HSG175 reinforces this requirement. Using an inflatable without a valid annual test certificate puts you at legal risk and may invalidate your insurance.

## BS EN 14960

BS EN 14960 is the British and European safety standard for inflatable play equipment. It covers design, manufacture, and ongoing safety requirements for bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment. Annual testing checks your inflatables against this standard.

## How Testing Works

I test your inflatables against BS EN 14960 and issue a test certificate. There are different routes:

- **PIPA scheme** – a database scheme where a numbered tag is logged on a public register
- **ADiPS scheme** – another HSE-recognised inspection scheme
- **Independent test and certificate** – tested to the same BS EN 14960 standard, with a certificate issued directly to you

All routes are equally valid and accepted by insurers and local authorities. The legal requirement under PUWER is that the inspection is carried out by a competent person against BS EN 14960. That's what matters — not which scheme or database the result is logged on. Whichever route you choose, you get a certificate proving your inflatable has been tested and meets the standard. Hire companies should keep these certificates and be able to show them to clients or councils on request.

## Operator Training

As a PIPA accredited trainer, I also provide operator training for people who run inflatables. This covers how to safely set up, supervise, and operate inflatable equipment — a requirement under health and safety law for anyone whose staff use or supervise inflatables.

## What Gets Checked

The annual test covers the whole inflatable:

- Fabric condition and stitching – looking for wear, tears, and UV degradation
- Anchor points – checking they are secure and in the right positions
- Blower attachments – tubes, connections, and airflow
- Structural integrity when inflated – shape, firmness, and stability
- Step and slide surfaces – grip, padding, and wear
- Seams and bonding – checking for separation or weakness
- Safety netting and containment walls
- Deflation rate – how quickly it loses air, which affects safety if the blower fails

If something fails, I'll record why and explain what needs repairing. Once repairs are done, the inflatable can be re-tested.

## Your Responsibilities as an Operator

Between annual tests, operators should check inflatables before every use:

- Check the blower is working properly
- Inspect fabric for new tears or damage
- Check anchor points are all present and secure
- Make sure the inflatable holds its shape when inflated
- Never use inflatables in winds above 24 mph – use an anemometer, not a phone weather app

## Who This Is For

Hire companies, leisure centres, holiday parks, schools, and anyone else with inflatables that need their annual test. I'm based in [Chorley](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA) and cover the North West. [Get in touch](/contact/) to book.
