The testing of inflatables is required once a year and we offer this via the PIPA scheme or our own in-house test and certificate. Both tests comply with the standard BS EN14960-2013 and are recognised by the H.S.E and local councils. We also provide a repair and/or modification service to any inflatable and can advise the best place to purchase additional or replacement equipment as we work closely with most manufacturers based in the North of England.
