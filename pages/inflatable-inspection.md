# Inflatable Inspection

Alongside play area inspections, I'm also registered to inspect inflatables – bouncy castles, inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and similar equipment.

## Annual Testing

Inflatables need testing once a year. I can do this through:

- **PIPA scheme** – the industry standard, recognised by HSE and councils
- **In-house test and certificate** – also compliant with BS EN14960

Both are accepted by insurers and local authorities. I'm a PIPA-registered Inflatable Annual Inspector.

## What's Checked

- Fabric condition and stitching
- Anchor points
- Blower attachments
- Structural integrity when inflated
- Step and slide surfaces

## Who This Is For

Hire companies, leisure centres, holiday parks, schools, and anyone else with inflatables that need their annual test. If you're in the North West, [get in touch](/contact/).
