The testing of inflatables is required once a year and we offer this via the PIPA scheme or our own in-house test and certificate. Both tests comply with the standard BS EN14960 and are recognised by the H.S.E and local councils.

Gary Spencer Bonehill is listed on the Register of Play Inspectors International (RPII) as a qualified Inflatable Annual Inspector.

We also provide a repair and/or modification service to any inflatable and can advise the best place to purchase additional or replacement equipment as we work closely with most manufacturers based in the North of England.
