  - question: "Do I need a risk assessment for my playground?"
    answer: "Yes. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, every owner or manager of a playground has a legal duty to carry out a risk assessment. This applies to all types of play area — indoor and outdoor, public and private. A risk assessment should identify potential hazards and set out measures to control them."
  - question: "What is the difference between an inspection and a risk assessment?"
    answer: "An inspection examines the physical condition of equipment right now — what is worn, broken, or not meeting standards. A risk assessment looks at what could go wrong — evaluating the likelihood and severity of hazardous events and identifying what should be done to reduce the risk. Both are important. Inspections are a snapshot of condition; risk assessments are about prevention and planning."
  - question: "Do insurers require a risk assessment?"
    answer: "Many do, yes. Insurance policies frequently require risk assessment documentation as a condition of cover. Without them, claims may be invalidated, leaving you exposed to significant financial liability. Having a current risk assessment and regular inspection records can also help reduce your insurance premiums."

# Risk Assessments & Insurance Support

I provide risk assessments for indoor and outdoor play facilities, and I help when things have gone wrong – working with insurers and loss adjusters after incidents.

## Risk Assessments

Every inspection includes risk ratings for any issues found. I use a 5x5 matrix – likelihood of injury against severity – so you can see at a glance what needs dealing with first.

But I also do standalone risk assessments:

- **New sites** – before opening, to document that everything's in order
- **After modifications** – when equipment has been added or changed
- **Insurance requirements** – some insurers want a current risk assessment on file
- **Due diligence** – if you're taking over a site or buying a business

The assessment covers the equipment, the surfaces, the layout, supervision arrangements, signage, and anything else relevant to the site.

## Insurance and Claims Support

When there's been an accident and a claim comes in, insurers and loss adjusters often need an independent inspection. I get called in to assess what happened, whether the equipment was at fault, and whether maintenance was adequate.

I've done this work for:

- Insurance companies investigating claims
- Loss adjusters assessing liability
- Solicitors building a case (either side)
- Site owners who need evidence for their defence

I'll inspect the equipment, review maintenance records, and provide a report setting out what I found. If needed, I can provide a statement or attend as an expert witness.

## After an Incident

If something's happened at your site and you're not sure what to do next, give me a ring. I'm based in [Chorley, Lancashire](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA) and cover the whole North West. I can inspect the equipment, advise whether it should be taken out of use, and help you document everything while it's fresh. Getting this right early makes a difference if there's a claim later.
