      I'm Gary Spencer Bonehill, and I carry out playground inspections in Blackpool and along the Fylde Coast. I'm based in Chorley, which is about 30 miles east of Blackpool — roughly 40 minutes via the M55. It's a straightforward drive across Lancashire.

      Blackpool is a busy place for play equipment. As a major resort town, it has a high concentration of both outdoor playgrounds and indoor play centres — from public parks and school playgrounds to the kind of commercial indoor play facilities and holiday park play areas that come with being a seaside destination. All of that equipment needs regular inspection.

      I inspect outdoor playgrounds and indoor soft play centres to BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177 standards.

      Blackpool's mix of public, school, and commercial play facilities means there's demand for inspections, but the same national companies dominate the search results — Playground Safety Inspector, Qualified Annual Playground Inspections, The Play Inspection Company, and Safeplay. These are nationwide outfits that send inspectors from wherever they happen to have availability.

      For a town that relies heavily on tourism and hospitality, the quality of play equipment inspections matters. Holiday parks, amusement venues, and indoor play centres need inspectors who understand the extra wear that comes with high-volume, year-round public use. A checklist-only approach can miss things that a more experienced eye would catch.

      Here's what I bring to the table:

      - **Genuinely independent.** I don't sell, install, or repair playground equipment. My inspection reports are objective and free from any commercial pressure. That matters if you need to show insurers or licensing bodies that your inspection was independent.
      - **Direct contact.** You deal with me, not a booking system. If you have questions before, during, or after the inspection, you talk to the person who actually did the work.
      - **25 years of mechanical engineering.** Blackpool's play equipment takes a battering — salt air, heavy use, and weather all accelerate wear. My engineering background means I understand corrosion, material fatigue, and structural stress in a way that goes beyond ticking boxes on a form.
      - **Local enough to be practical.** I'm 40 minutes away in Chorley, not being dispatched from a national head office. I know Lancashire, I know the roads, and I'm available without long lead times.
      - **RPII registered.** Same professional standards as the big firms. Same qualifications, better personal service.

      Blackpool's holiday parks, play centres, and council play areas all benefit from an inspector who can spot the kind of wear that high-use environments create. That engineering eye is what I offer.
