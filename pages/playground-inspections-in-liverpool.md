      I'm Gary Spencer Bonehill, and I carry out playground inspections in Liverpool and across Merseyside. I'm based in Chorley, Lancashire — about 30 miles north-east of Liverpool, which is around 45 minutes via the M6 and M58. It's a straightforward motorway run.

      Liverpool has a large number of parks, schools, and play facilities. From Sefton Park and Newsham Park to school playgrounds across the city and indoor play centres in the suburbs, there's a lot of play equipment that needs regular inspection. I cover it all — outdoor playgrounds and indoor soft play.

      All inspections are carried out to BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177 standards.

      Liverpool and Merseyside are served almost entirely by national companies. The Play Inspection Company, Playground Safety Inspector, Wicksteed, idverde, Safeplay, and Sovereign Compliance all cover the area — but none of them are based locally. They operate national networks and send whoever is available.

      There aren't many genuinely local, independent playground inspectors serving Liverpool. Most of what you'll find online is either a national chain or a large company that also sells and installs equipment. That's the gap I fill.

      Here's what makes me different:

      - **Independent.** I don't sell or install playground equipment. I have no commercial relationship with any equipment supplier. When I flag something in a report, it's because it needs attention — not because I'm trying to generate follow-up sales.
      - **Personal service.** Liverpool is a big city, and the national companies treat it like a pin on a map. I treat it as a place where I know the roads, can arrange inspections directly, and am available to answer questions about the report afterwards. You deal with me, not a call centre.
      - **Engineering background.** My 25 years as a mechanical engineer gives me an edge when assessing structural issues. I understand how metals behave under stress, how corrosion progresses, and what fatigue looks like before it becomes failure. Liverpool's coastal climate means corrosion is a real factor for outdoor play equipment.
      - **Reliable and consistent.** You get the same inspector every time. I know your site, I know what was flagged last year, and I can track how issues develop over time. That continuity is valuable.
      - **RPII registered.** I hold the same professional registration as inspectors working for the national firms. Same standards, more personal service.

      I cover Liverpool city centre and the wider Merseyside area including Southport, St Helens, Knowsley, Wirral, and Sefton. Whether you're a school, a council, a housing association, or a commercial play centre, [get in touch](/contact/) for a quote.
faqs:
  - question: "How much does a playground inspection in Liverpool cost?"
    answer: "It varies depending on the site and the equipment. Contact me for a straightforward quote."
  - question: "Do you cover the whole of Merseyside?"
    answer: "Yes. I cover Liverpool, Southport, St Helens, Knowsley, Wirral, and Sefton."
  - question: "Is the coastal climate a factor in playground inspections?"
    answer: "It can be. Coastal air accelerates corrosion on metal equipment and fixings. My mechanical engineering background means I'm well placed to assess corrosion-related wear and advise on it."
