I've been inspecting indoor play areas for about six years now. Started with Pontins holiday parks and local soft play centres, and it's grown from there.

## BS EN 1176-10: Fully Enclosed Play Equipment

Indoor soft play structures fall under **BS EN 1176-10** – the part of the standard covering fully enclosed play equipment. The 2023 revision sets out requirements for:

- Access and escape routes
- Visibility (can staff see children throughout the structure?)
- Containment – walls, netting, barriers
- Ignition resistance of materials
- Impact-absorbing surfaces within the structure
- Signage and age guidance

## What Gets Inspected

I check all of the above, plus the practical stuff that affects safety day-to-day:

- Soft play structures and frames
- Ball pits
- Slides and tunnels
- Padding condition – splits, compression, exposed foam
- Netting integrity – tears, loose fixings
- Entry/exit points
- Entrapment hazards – gaps where heads or limbs could get stuck

## Annual Inspections

Indoor play areas need a full inspection at least once a year. I go through the whole structure – checking for wear, damage, loose fixings, foam degradation, netting tears, and anything else that could cause problems.

You get a written report detailing what I've found and what needs attention. If something's a safety issue, I'll tell you on the day so you can deal with it straight away.

## Operational Inspections

Between annual inspections, I can do regular checks – monthly or quarterly depending on how busy your site is. High-traffic play centres see more wear, so more frequent checks make sense.

## Risk Assessments

I provide risk assessments for indoor play facilities. Useful for your own records, insurance purposes, or if you're opening a new site and need documentation in place.

## Who I Work With

Play centres, leisure centres, holiday parks, pubs with play areas, restaurants with soft play, nurseries – anywhere with indoor play equipment that needs checking.
