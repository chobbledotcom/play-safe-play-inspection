I've been inspecting indoor play areas for about six years now. Started with Pontins holiday parks and local soft play centres, and it's grown from there.

## What Gets Inspected

Indoor play equipment falls under BS EN1176 standards, same as outdoor. I check:

- Soft play structures and frames
- Ball pits
- Slides and tunnels
- Padding and impact surfaces
- Netting and barriers
- Entry/exit points
- Age-appropriate signage

## Annual Inspections

Indoor play areas need a full inspection at least once a year. I go through the whole structure – checking for wear, damage, loose fixings, foam degradation, netting tears, and anything else that could cause problems.

You get a written report detailing what I've found and what needs attention. If something's a safety issue, I'll tell you on the day so you can deal with it straight away.

## Operational Inspections

Between annual inspections, I can do regular checks – monthly or quarterly depending on how busy your site is. High-traffic play centres see more wear, so more frequent checks make sense.

## Risk Assessments

I provide risk assessments for indoor play facilities. Useful for your own records, insurance purposes, or if you're opening a new site and need documentation in place.

## Who I Work With

Play centres, leisure centres, holiday parks, pubs with play areas, restaurants with soft play, nurseries – anywhere with indoor play equipment that needs checking.
