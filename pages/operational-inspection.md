  - question: "How often should operational inspections be done?"
    answer: "BS EN 1176-7 recommends operational inspections every one to three months, depending on how busy the site is and the condition of the equipment. Monthly checks are sensible for high-traffic public parks and school playgrounds. Quarterly checks may be enough for quieter, lower-use sites. The frequency should be based on your own risk assessment."
  - question: "Can our own staff do operational inspections?"
    answer: "Yes, if they are properly trained. BS EN 1176-7 says operational inspections should be carried out by someone with appropriate training. Some organisations train their own grounds or maintenance staff. Alternatively, you can have an external specialist do them on a regular schedule."
  - question: "What is the difference between operational and annual inspections?"
    answer: "Operational inspections happen every one to three months and focus on things that change — wear and tear, loose fixings, vandalism, surface condition, and moving parts. Annual inspections happen once a year and are the most comprehensive check, covering structural integrity, full standards compliance, surfacing adequacy, and a complete risk assessment. The annual inspection must be done by an independent, qualified inspector."

# Operational Inspections

**BS EN 1176-7** sets out three levels of playground inspection:

1. **Routine visual** – daily or weekly checks by site staff
2. **Operational** – more detailed checks at regular intervals (what this page covers)
3. **Annual main inspection** – full inspection by a qualified inspector

Annual inspections are the minimum formal requirement. But for busy sites, or anywhere that sees vandalism, regular operational inspections between annual checks catch problems before they become serious.

## How Often

It depends on the site:

- **Monthly** – high-use sites, public parks, school playgrounds
- **Quarterly** – lower-use sites, private facilities, housing estate play areas

The more footfall and the more vandalism you get, the more often you should be checking. BS EN 1176-7 says you should set the frequency based on your own risk assessment for each site.

## What Gets Checked

Operational inspections focus on things that change between annual inspections:

- Surface condition – displacement, compaction, contamination
- Loose or missing fixings
- Vandalism damage – graffiti, broken parts, burned surfaces
- Wear on moving parts – swings, roundabouts
- Sharp edges or protrusions that have developed
- Litter, glass, dog fouling

I'm not re-doing the full annual inspection each time. This is a targeted check of the things most likely to have changed.

## Why Bother

If someone gets hurt on your playground and you haven't checked it since the last annual inspection, that's a problem. Regular documented inspections show you're taking reasonable steps to maintain the site.

It also saves money in the long run. Catching a worn swing seat early is cheaper than replacing the whole swing after the chains have damaged the frame.

## Scheduling

I can set up a regular schedule – same day each month or quarter – so you don't have to think about it. Some councils and housing associations I work with have been on the same schedule for years.
