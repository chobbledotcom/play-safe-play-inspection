Annual inspections are the minimum. For busy sites, or anywhere that sees vandalism, regular operational inspections between annual checks catch problems before they become serious.

## How Often

Depends on the site:

- **Monthly** – high-use sites, public parks, school playgrounds
- **Quarterly** – lower-use sites, private facilities, housing estate play areas

The more footfall and the more vandalism you get, the more often you should be checking.

## What Gets Checked

Operational inspections focus on things that change between annual inspections:

- Surface condition – displacement, compaction, contamination
- Loose or missing fixings
- Vandalism damage – graffiti, broken parts, burned surfaces
- Wear on moving parts – swings, roundabouts
- Sharp edges or protrusions that have developed
- Litter, glass, dog fouling

I'm not re-doing the full annual inspection each time. This is a targeted check of the things most likely to have changed.

## Why Bother

If someone gets hurt on your playground and you haven't checked it since the last annual inspection, that's a problem. Regular documented inspections show you're taking reasonable steps to maintain the site.

It also saves money in the long run. Catching a worn swing seat early is cheaper than replacing the whole swing after the chains have damaged the frame.

## Scheduling

I can set up a regular schedule – same day each month or quarter – so you don't have to think about it. Some councils and housing associations I work with have been on the same schedule for years.
