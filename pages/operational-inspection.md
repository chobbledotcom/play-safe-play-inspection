The inspection of outdoor playgrounds on a monthly or quarterly basis is strongly advised to inspect the equipment and contents mainly for wear and tear, vandalism and the condition of surfaces for damage. In our opinion this is imperative to maintain a high level of safety and to identify any issues that may cause a risk in between annual inspections.
