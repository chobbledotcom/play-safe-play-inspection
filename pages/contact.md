# Get in Touch

Give me a ring or drop me an email to book an inspection or ask any questions.

**Phone:** 07752 805 573

**Email:** info@playsafeplayinspection.co.uk

**Based:** Chorley, Lancashire ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA))

## How Booking Works

1. Get in touch with details of what you need – type of site, location, how many pieces of equipment roughly
2. I'll give you a quote
3. We arrange a date that works for you
4. I come out, do the inspection, and you get a written report

For regular clients with multiple sites or ongoing operational inspections, I can set up a schedule so you don't have to keep booking individually.

## Coverage

I'm based in the North West and cover Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, and Cumbria as standard. I can travel further if needed.
