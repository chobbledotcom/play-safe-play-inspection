      I'm based in [Chorley, Lancashire](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hp4yjVUpcHvJiGVA), which puts me right in the middle of the North West. Most of the towns and cities I work in are within 30 to 45 minutes' drive.

      I carry out annual inspections, operational inspections, and risk assessments for schools, councils, holiday parks, play centres, and anyone else responsible for play equipment. I cover indoor soft play and outdoor playgrounds.

      Here are some of the main areas I serve:
