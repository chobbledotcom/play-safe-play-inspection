## About

I'm Gary Spencer Bonehill, an RPII-registered play inspector based in Chorley, Lancashire. I inspect indoor play areas and outdoor playgrounds for local authorities, schools, holiday parks, and play centres.

I've been doing this for 9 years now. Before that I spent 25 years as a mechanical engineer, which comes in handy when you're checking equipment for structural issues and wear.

## What I Do

- **[Indoor play area inspections](/indoor-play-inspection/)** – soft play centres, play frames, ball pits (BS EN 1176-10)
- **[Outdoor playground inspections](/annual-inspection/)** – annual and operational inspections (BS EN 1176 / BS EN 1177)
- **[Risk assessments](/risk-overview/)** – for both indoor and outdoor sites
- **Insurance and claims support** – I work with loss adjusters when there's been an incident

I started out inspecting sites for Pontins and local play centres about six years back for the indoor work. The outdoor stuff I've been doing longer. These days I work with councils, schools, nurseries, leisure centres, and private play businesses across the North West.

## The Standards

Play equipment safety in the UK falls under **BS EN 1176** (equipment) and **BS EN 1177** (surfacing). These aren't legally mandatory, but they're what courts, insurers, and local authorities use to judge whether you've met your duty of care.

BS EN 1176 has multiple parts covering different equipment types – Part 7 sets out inspection requirements, Part 10 covers fully enclosed play equipment like soft play centres. BS EN 1177 deals with impact-absorbing surfaces and how they're tested.

Annual inspections need to be carried out by someone registered with the RPII (Register of Play Inspectors International). That's me.

## Coverage

Based in Chorley but I cover the whole of the North West – Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Cumbria. I'll travel further afield if needed, just get in touch.

## One Man Operation

It's just me. When you book an inspection, you deal with me directly. No call centres, no being passed around. I've been doing this long enough to know what I'm looking at, and I'll tell you straight what needs sorting.
