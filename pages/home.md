## Introduction

Children's play is very important for social and interactive development in their early years. We offer inspections for inflatables and outdoor playgrounds to the relevant standards to ensure play is as safe as it can possibly be. We are North West based but travel all over the country offering an affordable service and advice.

Gary Spencer Bonehill is a registered inspector with the Register of Play Inspectors International (RPII), the official UK body for examining, accrediting and certificating inflatable and outdoor play inspectors.
