      I'm Gary Spencer Bonehill, a qualified play inspector based in Chorley, Lancashire. I inspect indoor play areas and outdoor playgrounds for local authorities, schools, holiday parks, and play centres.

      I've been doing this for 9 years now. Before that I spent 25 years as a mechanical engineer, which is useful when checking equipment for structural issues and wear.

      It's just me running this. When you book an inspection, you deal with me directly. No call centres, no being passed around.

      Play equipment safety in the UK falls under **BS EN 1176** (equipment) and **BS EN 1177** (surfacing). These aren't legally mandatory, but they're what courts, insurers, and local authorities use to judge whether you've met your duty of care.

      - **BS EN 1176** has multiple parts covering different equipment types
      - **Part 7** sets out inspection requirements
      - **Part 10** covers fully enclosed play equipment like soft play centres
      - **BS EN 1177** deals with impact-absorbing surfaces and testing

      Annual inspections need to be carried out by a qualified inspector. That's me – with 25 years of mechanical engineering experience and over 9 years inspecting play equipment.
