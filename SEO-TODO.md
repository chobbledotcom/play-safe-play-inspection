# How to get more people finding your website on Google

## What I did

I looked at your website and compared it to the businesses that currently
show up when someone searches for "playground inspection" or "indoor play
centre inspection" on Google.

Your main competitors online are:

- **The Play Inspection Company** (playinspections.co.uk) - nationwide,
  very strong website with blog, testimonials, training courses, and
  location pages
- **Playground Inspections UK** (playgroundinspections.uk) - has 25
  separate pages for different areas of the UK (Glasgow, Kent, Hampshire
  etc)
- **Safeplay** (safeplay.co.uk) - London & South East focused, strong
  on testimonials and qualifications
- **ESP Play** (espplay.co.uk) - has inspection services plus training
- **Soft Play Equipment UK** (soft-play-equipment.co.uk) - has 50+
  location pages and very long, detailed content

Your website is well written and professional. The content is good
quality. But compared to these competitors, there are some important
things missing that Google looks for when deciding who to show first.

Here are 20 things you can do, in order of importance. I've tried to
explain each one simply.

---

## The jobs (in priority order)

### 1. Set up your Google Business Profile (free, very important)

This is the single most important thing you can do. When someone
searches "playground inspection near me" or "playground inspection
Chorley", Google shows a map with local businesses on it. If you don't
have a Google Business Profile, you won't appear there at all.

**What to do:**

- Go to google.com/business and sign in with a Google account
- Add your business name: "Play Safe Play Inspections"
- Add your address in Chorley (even if you work from home, you can hide
  the street address and just show the area)
- Add your phone number and website address
- Choose your business category - try "Playground Equipment Inspector"
  or "Safety Consultant"
- Add your opening hours
- Add a description of what you do (mention playground inspection, soft
  play inspection, North West, Lancashire, the standards you work to)
- Add photos of you at work, your inspection reports, playgrounds you've
  inspected

### 2. Ask happy customers to leave you a Google review

Google reviews are one of the biggest things that affect where you
show up in search results. Your competitors have reviews and you don't
yet. Even 5-10 good reviews would make a big difference.

**What to do:**

- After each job, send the customer a text or email saying something
  like: "Thanks for using Play Safe. If you were happy with the
  inspection, I'd really appreciate a quick Google review - it helps
  other people find me." Then include your Google review link (you get
  this from your Google Business Profile)
- Don't be shy about asking - most people are happy to help, they just
  don't think of it

### 3. Add answers to common questions on each page (FAQs)

Your website already has the ability to add "Frequently Asked Questions"
to each page - it's just not being used yet. Google loves FAQ sections
because they match exactly what people type into search. When someone
searches "how often does a playground need inspecting?" and your page
has that exact question answered, Google is much more likely to show
your page.

**What to do:** Add 3-5 questions and answers to each of your main
pages. Here are some suggestions:

**For the Annual Inspection page:**
- "How often does a playground need a full inspection?" - At least once
  a year, as set out in BS EN 1176-7
- "Who can carry out an annual playground inspection?" - It must be done
  by a qualified inspector
- "What happens if my playground fails the inspection?" - You get a
  report listing what needs fixing, with risk ratings so you know what's
  most urgent
- "How much does a playground inspection cost?" - It depends on the
  size of the site - get in touch for a quote

**For the Indoor Play Inspection page:**
- "Do soft play centres need an annual inspection?" - Yes, BS EN
  1176-10 covers fully enclosed play equipment
- "What does an indoor play inspection check?" - Everything from
  padding condition to escape routes to entrapment hazards
- "Can you inspect during opening hours?" - Get in touch to discuss
  what works for your site

**For the other pages:** Think about the questions your customers
actually ask you on the phone, and write those down with your answers.

### 4. Write more on each page (your pages are quite short)

Your competitors' pages have 1,000-3,000 words on them. Your pages
have about 150-450 words each. Google tends to prefer pages with more
detailed, useful content because it sees them as more helpful to the
person searching.

This doesn't mean waffling - it means going into more detail about what
you actually do.

**What to do:** On each service page, try adding:

- A section about **what happens on the day** - what time you arrive,
  how long it takes, what equipment you bring, what you do step by step
- A **real example** (without naming the client) - "I recently inspected
  a school playground with 12 pieces of equipment and found..."
- More detail about **why this matters** - what can go wrong if you
  don't get an inspection, what has happened at sites that weren't
  inspected properly
- Information about **what the report looks like** - how long it is,
  what's in it, how quickly they get it

Aim for at least 800-1,000 words per service page.

### 5. Create pages for the areas you cover

One of your biggest competitors (playgroundinspections.uk) has 25
separate pages for different locations. Another (soft-play-equipment.co.uk)
has over 50. This is because when someone searches "playground inspection
Manchester" or "soft play inspection Lancashire", Google looks for pages
that mention those specific places.

**What to do:** Create a page for each main area you cover:

- Playground inspection Lancashire
- Playground inspection Greater Manchester
- Playground inspection Merseyside
- Playground inspection Cheshire
- Playground inspection Cumbria
- Soft play inspection Lancashire
- Soft play inspection Manchester

Each page should talk about the work you've done in that area, the
types of clients you work with there (councils, schools, holiday parks),
and any local knowledge you have. Don't just copy the same text and
change the place name - Google can tell if you do that and it won't
help.

### 6. Add your real photos to the website

Right now the site uses stock-looking images. If you have photos from
actual inspections you've done (or can take some on your next few jobs),
this would make the site look more trustworthy to both Google and
potential customers.

**What to do:**

- Take photos on your phone during inspections (with the client's
  permission) - you inspecting equipment, your clipboard/tablet,
  examples of things you find
- Photos of different types of equipment you inspect
- A photo of yourself (people hire people, not websites)

### 7. Add descriptions to your images (alt text)

Google can't "see" photos the way we can. It relies on a text
description attached to each image (called "alt text") to understand
what the photo shows. Your images don't have these descriptions yet.

**What to do:** Your website system has a place to add alt text to
images. Each image needs a short description like:

- "Inspector checking soft play equipment padding at an indoor play
  centre"
- "Outdoor playground with swings and climbing frame during annual
  safety inspection"
- "Playground inspection report with risk ratings"

### 8. Add customer quotes to your website

Your competitors display quotes from happy customers on their websites.
The Play Inspection Company shows quotes from councils and Forestry
England. This builds trust with new visitors.

Your website already has a "reviews" section built in - it's just empty.

**What to do:**

- Ask 3-5 of your best customers if you can use a quote from them on
  your website
- Even short ones work well: "Gary is thorough, professional, and his
  reports are clear and useful" - Head Teacher, St Mary's Primary School
- If you start getting Google reviews (from job 2), those can go on the
  website too

### 9. Get your business listed in online directories

Google trusts businesses more when it sees the same name, address, and
phone number appearing on other trusted websites. This is called
"citations" and it's one of the ways Google checks you're a real
business.

**What to do:** List your business (for free) on:

- Yell.com
- Thomson Local
- Bing Places (like Google Business Profile but for Bing)
- FreeIndex
- Bark.com
- Checkatrade (this one costs money but is well known)
- Your local Lancashire business directory
- Any trade associations you belong to (RPII has a register - make sure
  you're on it)

Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are written
**exactly the same** on every site.

### 10. Start a simple blog / news section

Your competitors who rank well have a news section where they
occasionally write about things happening in the industry. Your
website already supports a news section - it just hasn't been set up
yet.

You don't need to write often. Even one post every month or two
would help. The point is to have pages on your site that answer the
questions people are searching for.

**Ideas for posts:**

- "What to check on your playground before the school holidays"
- "New changes to BS EN 1176 - what playground owners need to know"
- "5 common soft play problems I find on inspections"
- "Why your pub playground needs an annual inspection"
- "How to choose a playground inspector"
- "What happens during a playground annual inspection"
- "Playground surfacing: rubber vs wet-pour vs bark"

Each post only needs to be about 500-800 words. Write it how you'd
explain it to a customer on the phone.

### 11. Put your phone number bigger on every page

Your phone number is in the footer and on the contact page, but
someone visiting your site on their phone might not scroll that far.
Making it very easy to call you means more enquiries.

**What to do:**

- Make sure your phone number appears near the top of every page
- On a mobile phone, it should be a button people can tap to call you
  directly

### 12. Fill in your full business details in the website settings

Your website has a settings area for your full business details
(address, founding date, etc.) that helps Google understand your
business. Some of these are currently blank.

**What to do:** Fill in:

- Your founding date (the year you started doing inspections)
- Your full street address (if you're comfortable sharing it)
- Double-check the phone number matches everywhere (I noticed the
  contact page says 07752 805 573 but the settings file has a different
  number - these need to match)

### 13. Set up a Facebook page

You don't need to be posting every day or anything like that. But
having a Facebook business page that links to your website is another
signal to Google that you're a real, active business. It also gives
people another way to find you.

**What to do:**

- Create a Facebook business page for "Play Safe Play Inspections"
- Add your logo, a description of what you do, your phone number, and
  your website address
- Post something on it once every few weeks - even just "Off to inspect
  a playground in Bolton today" with a photo
- Link to it from your website (your website already has a place for a
  Facebook link)

### 14. Add a page about yourself with your qualifications

Your homepage mentions your background briefly, but a dedicated "About"
page where you go into more detail about your qualifications, your RPII
registration, your engineering background, and why you started the
business would help build trust. Your competitors emphasise their
qualifications heavily.

**What to do:** Write a page that covers:

- Your engineering background (25 years - this is impressive, talk about
  it more)
- When and why you got into playground inspection
- Your RPII registration and what that means
- Your PIPA registration for inflatables
- Any other training or qualifications
- A photo of yourself

### 15. Add your areas to Google Business Profile as service areas

This is an extra step for your Google Business Profile (from job 1).
You can tell Google all the areas you travel to for work.

**What to do:**

- In your Google Business Profile, go to the "Service areas" section
- Add: Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Cumbria
- This helps you show up when people in those areas search for
  playground inspections

### 16. Ask related businesses to link to your website

When other websites link to yours, Google sees this as a vote of
confidence. The more trusted websites that link to you, the higher
you'll rank.

**What to do:**

- Ask councils and schools you've worked with if they can add you to
  their "approved suppliers" or "useful links" page
- If you're a member of any trade bodies, make sure they link to your
  website in their member directory
- If equipment manufacturers or installers in your area know you, ask
  if they'd link to you as a recommended inspector
- Your local Chamber of Commerce website

### 17. Make your page titles more search-friendly

Your page titles are decent but could include more of the words people
actually search for. For example, people search for "playground
inspection" more than "outdoor annual inspection."

**Suggestions:**

- Annual Inspection page: change title to include "Playground Inspection"
  more prominently
- Indoor Play page: make sure "soft play inspection" appears early in
  the title (people search for "soft play inspection" a lot)
- Inflatable page: include "bouncy castle inspection" in the title
  (that's what most people call them)

### 18. Write content about the types of customers you help

Your competitors have content aimed at specific types of customers -
schools, councils, holiday parks, pubs. You mention these groups briefly
but dedicated content for each type of customer would help.

**What to do:** Either add sections to existing pages or create new
short pages for:

- "Playground inspections for schools" - what schools specifically need
  to know
- "Playground inspections for councils" - how you work with local
  authorities
- "Soft play inspections for leisure centres" - what leisure centre
  managers need
- "Play area inspections for pubs and restaurants" - the legal
  requirements for commercial play areas

### 19. Add a "What to expect" page

Many people searching for playground inspection don't know what's
involved. A simple page explaining "What happens during a playground
inspection" step by step would attract people who are just starting
to look into this.

**What to do:** Write a page covering:

- What happens before the visit (booking, what info you need)
- What happens on the day (how long it takes, what you check)
- What the report looks like
- What happens after (fixing issues, re-inspections)
- How often inspections are needed going forward

### 20. Check your website works well on phones

More than half of Google searches happen on mobile phones. If your
website is hard to use on a phone - text too small, buttons hard to
tap, pages slow to load - Google will rank you lower.

**What to do:**

- Look at your website on your phone and check everything looks right
- Make sure the phone number is easy to tap
- Make sure the text is big enough to read without zooming in
- Try the contact form on your phone

## A note about your competitors

Your biggest advantage is that you're a real person, local, with
genuine engineering expertise. Your competitors are mostly larger
companies. People searching locally often prefer to hire a local
independent inspector rather than a big company - but they can only
hire you if they can find you on Google.

The businesses ranking above you right now aren't necessarily better
at inspections. They've just done more of the things Google looks for
when deciding who to show first.

**Start with jobs 1 to 5.** These will make the biggest difference.
The rest can be done over time whenever you get a chance.
