# How to get more people finding your website on Google

## What I did

I looked at your website and compared it to the businesses that
currently show up when someone searches for "playground inspection" or
"indoor play centre inspection" on Google.

Your main competitors online are:

- **The Play Inspection Company** (playinspections.co.uk) - nationwide,
  very strong website with blog, testimonials, training courses, and
  location pages
- **Playground Inspections UK** (playgroundinspections.uk) - has 25
  separate pages for different areas of the UK
- **Safeplay** (safeplay.co.uk) - London & South East focused, strong
  on testimonials and qualifications
- **ESP Play** (espplay.co.uk) - has inspection services plus training
- **Soft Play Equipment UK** (soft-play-equipment.co.uk) - has 50+
  location pages and very long, detailed content

Your website is well written and professional. The content is good
quality. But compared to these competitors, there are some important
things missing that Google looks for when deciding who to show first.

## Already done

These things have already been sorted:

- **Google Business Profile set up** - you're now visible on Google
  Maps when people search locally.
- **Phone number fixed** - the website settings had a wrong phone
  number. It's now 07752 805 573 everywhere (contact page, footer,
  and the behind-the-scenes settings that Google reads).
- **Full address added** - your address (Highfield Road South, Chorley,
  PR7 1RH) is now in the behind-the-scenes business data so Google
  knows exactly where you are.
- **Google Maps link added across the site** - your Google Maps listing
  now links from the contact page, the footer on every page, the
  homepage, and at the bottom of every service page.
- **FAQs added to all five service pages** - 23 questions and answers
  based on official sources (RoSPA, HSE, BSI, PIPA). These cover the
  most common things people search for: "how often does a playground
  need inspecting", "is a playground inspection a legal requirement",
  "what is PIPA", "do soft play centres need an inspection", "do I need
  a risk assessment for my playground", and many more.
- **Page titles improved for search** - changed to use the words people
  actually search for. "Inflatable Inspection" is now "Bouncy Castle &
  Inflatable Inspection", the indoor play page now leads with "Soft Play
  Centre Inspection", etc.
- **Image alt text added** - all three images now have descriptions
  that tell Google what the photos show.
- **Founding date added** - 2017 is now in the business data.
- **Page content expanded** - the annual inspection, indoor play, and
  inflatable pages now have significantly more detail about legal
  requirements, what gets checked, and what the standards say.

## What's left for you to do (in priority order)

### 1. Ask happy customers to leave you a Google review

Google reviews are one of the biggest things that affect where you
show up in search results. Your competitors have reviews and you don't
yet. Even 5-10 good reviews would make a big difference.

**What to do:** After each job, send the customer a text or email
saying something like: "Thanks for using Play Safe. If you were happy
with the inspection, I'd really appreciate a quick Google review - it
helps other people find me." Then include your Google review link (you
get this from your Google Business Profile).

Don't be shy about asking - most people are happy to help, they just
don't think of it.

### 2. Add your areas to Google Business Profile as service areas

In your Google Business Profile, go to the "Service areas" section and
add: Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Cumbria.
This helps you show up when people in those areas search for playground
inspections.

### 3. Create pages for the areas you cover

One of your biggest competitors (playgroundinspections.uk) has 25
separate pages for different locations. Another has over 50. This is
because when someone searches "playground inspection Manchester" or
"soft play inspection Lancashire", Google looks for pages that mention
those specific places.

**What to do:** Create a page for each main area you cover:

- Playground inspection Lancashire
- Playground inspection Greater Manchester
- Playground inspection Merseyside
- Playground inspection Cheshire
- Playground inspection Cumbria
- Soft play inspection Lancashire
- Soft play inspection Manchester

Each page should talk about the work you've done in that area, the
types of clients you work with there (councils, schools, holiday parks),
and any local knowledge you have. Don't just copy the same text and
change the place name - Google can tell if you do that and it won't
help.

### 4. Add your real photos to the website

Right now the site uses stock-looking images. If you have photos from
actual inspections you've done (or can take some on your next few jobs),
this would make the site look more trustworthy to both Google and
potential customers.

**What to do:**

- Take photos on your phone during inspections (with the client's
  permission) - you inspecting equipment, your clipboard/tablet,
  examples of things you find
- Photos of different types of equipment you inspect
- A photo of yourself (people hire people, not websites)

### 5. Add customer quotes to your website

Your competitors display quotes from happy customers on their websites.
This builds trust with new visitors.

Your website already has a "reviews" section built in - it's just empty.

**What to do:**

- Ask 3-5 of your best customers if you can use a quote from them on
  your website
- Even short ones work well: "Gary is thorough, professional, and his
  reports are clear and useful" - Head Teacher, St Mary's Primary
- If you start getting Google reviews (from job 1), those can go on the
  website too

### 6. Get your business listed in online directories

Google trusts businesses more when it sees the same name, address, and
phone number appearing on other trusted websites. This is called
"citations" and it's one of the ways Google checks you're a real
business.

**What to do:** List your business (for free) on:

- Yell.com
- Thomson Local
- Bing Places (like Google Business Profile but for Bing)
- FreeIndex
- Bark.com
- Checkatrade (this one costs money but is well known)
- Your local Lancashire business directory

You're already listed on the RPII register as an Inflatable Annual
Inspector (registration AI0138 at playinspectors.com) - that's good.
Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are written
**exactly the same** on every site.

### 7. Start a simple blog / news section

Your competitors who rank well have a news section where they
occasionally write about things happening in the industry. Your
website already supports a news section - it just hasn't been set up
yet.

You don't need to write often. Even one post every month or two would
help. The point is to have pages on your site that answer the questions
people are searching for.

**Ideas for posts:**

- "What to check on your playground before the school holidays"
- "New changes to BS EN 1176 - what playground owners need to know"
- "5 common soft play problems I find on inspections"
- "Why your pub playground needs an annual inspection"
- "How to choose a playground inspector"
- "What happens during a playground annual inspection"
- "Playground surfacing: rubber vs wet-pour vs bark"

Each post only needs to be about 500-800 words. Write it how you'd
explain it to a customer on the phone.

### 8. Add more personal detail to your service pages

The pages have been expanded with factual detail about the standards
and legal requirements, but only you can add the personal stuff that
makes your site different from everyone else's:

- **What happens on the day** - what time you arrive, how long it
  takes, what equipment you bring, what you do step by step
- **A real example** (without naming the client) - "I recently
  inspected a school playground with 12 pieces of equipment and
  found..."
- **What the report looks like** - how long it is, what's in it, how
  quickly they get it

### 9. Set up a Facebook page

You don't need to be posting every day. But having a Facebook business
page that links to your website is another signal to Google that you're
a real, active business.

**What to do:**

- Create a Facebook business page for "Play Safe Play Inspections"
- Add your logo, a description of what you do, your phone number, and
  your website address
- Post something on it once every few weeks - even just "Off to inspect
  a playground in Bolton today" with a photo
- Link to it from your website (your website already has a place for a
  Facebook link)

### 10. Add a page about yourself with your qualifications

Your homepage mentions your background briefly, but a dedicated "About"
page would help build trust. Your competitors emphasise their
qualifications heavily.

**What to do:** Write a page that covers:

- Your engineering background (25 years - this is impressive, talk
  about it more)
- When and why you got into playground inspection
- Your RPII registration as an Inflatable Annual Inspector (AI0138)
- Your PIPA registration
- Any other training or qualifications you hold
- A photo of yourself

### 11. Ask related businesses to link to your website

When other websites link to yours, Google sees this as a vote of
confidence. The more trusted websites that link to you, the higher
you'll rank.

**What to do:**

- Ask councils and schools you've worked with if they can add you to
  their "approved suppliers" or "useful links" page
- If you're a member of any trade bodies, make sure they link to your
  website in their member directory
- If equipment manufacturers or installers in your area know you, ask
  if they'd link to you as a recommended inspector
- Your local Chamber of Commerce website

### 12. Write content about the types of customers you help

Your competitors have content aimed at specific types of customers.
Dedicated content for each type would help you show up in more
searches.

**What to do:** Either add sections to existing pages or create new
short pages for:

- "Playground inspections for schools"
- "Playground inspections for councils"
- "Soft play inspections for leisure centres"
- "Play area inspections for pubs and restaurants"

### 13. Check your website works well on phones

More than half of Google searches happen on mobile phones. If your
website is hard to use on a phone, Google will rank you lower.

**What to do:**

- Look at your website on your phone and check everything looks right
- Make sure the phone number is easy to tap
- Make sure the text is big enough to read without zooming in
- Try the contact form on your phone

## A note about your competitors

Your biggest advantage is that you're a real person, local, with
genuine engineering expertise. Your competitors are mostly larger
companies. People searching locally often prefer to hire a local
independent inspector rather than a big company - but they can only
hire you if they can find you on Google.

The businesses ranking above you right now aren't necessarily better at
inspections. They've just done more of the things Google looks for when
deciding who to show first.

**Start with jobs 1 to 3.** Getting reviews, adding your service areas,
and creating location pages will make the biggest difference. The rest
can be done over time whenever you get a chance.
