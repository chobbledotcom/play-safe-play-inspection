## WHY THIS MATTERS

### For Google (E-E-A-T):
- **Experience:** Showing you've actually done the work, not just read about it
- **Expertise:** Qualifications, training, depth of knowledge
- **Authoritativeness:** Recognition, testimonials, industry relationships
- **Trustworthiness:** Insurance, verifiable credentials, transparency

### For Customers:
- People buy from people they trust
- Your story and personality differentiate you from faceless competitors
- Social proof (testimonials, numbers) reduces perceived risk
- Photos make you real and approachable

### Current Site Status:
Your current website has the basics but lacks:
- Your personal story
- Specific numbers (years experience, inspections done)
- Customer testimonials
- Photos of you or your work
- Detailed service descriptions
- FAQs answering common questions
- Anything that couldn't be written about any other inspector

**With your answers to these questions, we can transform the site from a basic brochure into a trust-building, customer-converting, Google-ranking machine.**
